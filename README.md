<h2> What is this app about?</h2>

<p>As a future web-developer (&#129310;) I understand the necessity of improving my skills in this professional field. It can be achieved with some regular practice. This is why I look for different ideas for pet projects from time to time. This is one of my pet projects: <strong>to-do list</strong>. You can do the following things with this app: </p>
<ul>
<li> create your own account to keep your tasks in order </li>
<li> add to-do-cards that can be both small (only with a title and control buttons) and big (with a title, a full description and control buttons)</li>
<li> update to-do-cards </li>
<li> delete to-do-cards </li>
<li> see all the deleted cards on the separate page </li>
<li> bring all the deleted cards back </li>
<li> bring just one of the deleted cards back </li>
<li> delete your account completely </li>
</ul>
